# Spring Security Basics

This project demonstrates various Spring Security concepts and includes educational examples of security vulnerabilities.

## SQL Injection Simulation

This project includes a comprehensive demonstration of SQL injection vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms:

- **Automatic Simulation**: Runs at application startup to show SQL injection techniques
- **Interactive Web Endpoints**: Demonstrates vulnerable and secure API endpoints
- **User-Friendly Demo Page**: Provides a web interface for testing SQL injection
- **Educational Documentation**: Explains SQL injection concepts and best practices

### How to Access the SQL Injection Demo

1. Start the application
2. View the console output to see the automatic simulation results
3. Access the interactive demo page at: `/sql-injection-demo.html`
4. Try the example SQL injection payloads provided on the page

### Documentation

For detailed information about SQL injection, see:
- [SQL Injection Documentation](src/main/kotlin/org/security/basics/README_SQL_INJECTION.md)

## Warning

The SQL injection examples in this project are for educational purposes only. Never use these techniques against systems without explicit permission.
