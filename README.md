## Customize defaults: userDetailsService

### Overriding configuration styles
Better to use one style while overriding a configuration because of maintenability.
Beans, method overriding, add properties to components, ..

### UserDetailsService: Style 1 Bean
@Configuration, @Bean
`User` is provided by Spring Security. Authorities are mandatory (??)
{noop} will implement the PasswordEncoder (??)
The application will use this user and password, not the autogenerated one.

### UserDetailsService: Style 2 endpoint level
@Bean of type SecurityFilterChain ??
